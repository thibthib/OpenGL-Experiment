# OpenGL Experimentation

Here is a quick test of OpenGL I did while I was in school.

### Shortcuts

`1` : Shows the cubes and sphere scene  
`2` : Shows the (incomplete) solar system scene  
`3` : Shows the satellites scene

`Z` : Zoom in  
`D` : Zoom out  
`R` : Camera position and zoom reset  

`F` : Shows/hides the fog

`T` : Starts/stops the solar system / satellites rotations  
`L` : Shows/hides the objects' rotation path

`Up, Down, Left and Right` : Light source movement  
`I` : Sets the light source position relative to the camera (default)  
`M` : Sets the light source position relative to the scene  

`Q` or `Echap` : Quits the program
